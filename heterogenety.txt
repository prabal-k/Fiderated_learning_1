*****************************How It Works
1. Custom Aggregation:

Instead of simply averaging the model updates from all clients (as in traditional FedAvg), this strategy assigns attention weights to each client based on their performance (e.g., accuracy).
Clients with higher performance (accuracy) are given higher weights in the aggregation process, reflecting their contribution to the global model.

2. Attention Mechanism:

The attention weights are calculated using the softmax function over client accuracies, ensuring that the weights are positive and sum to 1.

3.Aggregation Process:

For each layer of the model, the server computes a weighted sum of the updates received from the clients using the attention weights.

4. Metrics Aggregation:

Custom metrics (e.g., average accuracy) are also aggregated across clients, and attention weights are included in the aggregated metrics.
